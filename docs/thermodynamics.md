## Optimization algorithm

To minimize the Gibbs energy function, the following methods are used:

* Augmented Lagrangian method
* Sequential Quadratic Programming

Optimization of the objective function is performed using the [NLopt](http://github.com/stevengj/nlopt) library.

## Adiabatic temperature
